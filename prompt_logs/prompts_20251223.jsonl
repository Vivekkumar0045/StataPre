Start with \"Survey Design: [query]\"\n2. Incorporate all classification categories naturally\n3. Explain the survey's purpose and methodology\n4. Mention sector-specific considerations\n5. Keep it concise (100-150 words)\n6. Use professional government survey terminology\n\nClassification Details:\n- Central (Level Based): Data aggregated at the national level, representing the entire country. Often used for macroeconomic indicators, national policy making, and international reporting.\n- Sample (Methodology Based): An in-depth survey of a scientifically selected subset of the population. Allows for detailed data collection on specific topics that would be infeasible in a census. Examples: NSS, NFHS, PLFS.\n- Monitoring & Evaluation (Purpose Based): Data used to track the progress and impact of ongoing schemes and policies.\n- Environment (Sectoral): Data concerning forest cover, biodiversity, pollution levels, and climate change indicators.\n- Topographical (Geographical): Data related to the physical features and elevation of the Earth's surface, produced by the Survey of India (SoI).\n- Ad hoc (Frequency Based): One-time or irregularly conducted surveys on specific subjects as per policy requirements.\n- Mixed Methods (Data Collection Method): Surveys that integrate both quantitative and qualitative data collection to provide a comprehensive understanding.\n\nDo NOT include:\n- State/district specific examples unless mentioned in query\n- Markdown formatting\n- Any JSON structures\n\nOutput ONLY the description text.\n"}
